/**
 * A zoom helps convert coordinates between two system: a base
 * system, and one that can be zoomed. The zoom level determines
 * the amount of scaling. The identity zoom level is 0 
 * (no zooming). Positive zoom levels are normally
 * associated with zooming in. Negative zoom levels lesser are
 * normally associated with zooming out. The zoom factor
 * is the amount of scaling to do. It is a function of the 
 * zoom level and a constant zoom increment. There is also
 * a max and a min possible zoom level, which is the same
 * for all zooms.
